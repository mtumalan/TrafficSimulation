# Unity Traffic Simulation with Python Backend

![Traffic Simulation Demo](link_to_demo_gif_or_screenshot.gif)

## Overview

This project is a Unity-based traffic simulation that utilizes a Python backend to control traffic patterns and simulate realistic scenarios. Whether you're interested in urban planning, autonomous vehicles, or just curious about traffic dynamics, this simulation provides a flexible environment for exploration.

## Features

- **Unity Frontend:** A visually appealing Unity interface that renders the simulated traffic environment.
- **Python Backend:** Backend logic implemented in Python for dynamic control of traffic patterns and simulation parameters.
  
## How It Works

The Unity frontend communicates with the Python backend to dynamically control traffic elements such as traffic lights, vehicle speed, and density. This interaction creates a realistic and customizable traffic simulation environment.
